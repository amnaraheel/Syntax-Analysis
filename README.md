# Syntax-Analysis
The ast (abstract syntax tree) module in Python provides tools for creating, manipulating, and transforming abstract syntax trees. An abstract syntax tree (AST) is a tree-like structure that represents the abstract syntactic structure of a piece of code. It is typically used as an intermediate representation of the code, allowing it to be transformed or optimized before being compiled or interpreted. This shows the structure of the AST for the expression "2 + 3 * 4". The root node of the tree is a Module node, which represents a Python module. It has a single child node, an Expr node, which represents an expression. The Expr node has a single child node, a BinOp node, which represents a binary operator. The BinOp node has three child nodes: a Num node for the number 2, an Add node for the plus operator, and another BinOp node for the expression "3 * 4".
